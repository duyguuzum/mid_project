# Ironhack Mid-Term Project

 The objective is to find solutions to questions about the relevant database using Python and its libraries. Includes machine learning models.

### Scenario

In this project we are working as analysts with a salaries database. We are going to create a machine learning model to find answers to our questions.
<a id='section2'></a>
### Objective

We also want to explore the characteristics of the salaries using some business intelligence tools. 
We followed this workflow in Python in order to build the required model:

### Approach

The dataset we used consists of information on 606 salaries and contains data of salaries between 2020 to 2022.
Our first approach consisted of:
                                * Importing the data
                                * Exploring the data (EDA Method)
                                * Data cleaning
                                * Check for multicolinearity

 <a id='section4'></a>
### First ideas

* The total dataset consited 606 rows.
We did not find any duplicated data, and also there wasn't missing values in our database.
* We found 4 types of work level that are Entry level, Executive , Middle and Senior. We also find three types of remote ratio that are %0, %50 and %100. 


<a id='section5'></a>
### In-Depth Analysis

* We proceeded to realize the first iteration of our Machine Learning Model, and we can get the answers to our questions, so the model performs well.
